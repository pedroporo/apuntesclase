# Game view

Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/1.-introduction-to-unity/exploring-unity-editor/game-view

* This view shows how your game will look like when playing (using the scene camera/s)
* At least, there must be **one** **camera** in the scene.

![[]]

* With these buttons we can run, pause or execute our game step by step.
* In the game view we can change the aspect ratio and resolution of the final game, maximize the game view when running and show some statistics about the game when running
* Experimenting with different aspect rations can be interesting in order to see how our game will adapt to different devices and screens

⚠️ **BE CAREFUL** ⚠️**: Unity** **allows** to make **changes while** we are **running** **the** **game** in the editor, **BUT** most of **these changes will be undone** **when** **stopping** **the** **game** in the game view (this is useful when trying new things but can also be dangerous when carrying out steps we want to be permanent)
