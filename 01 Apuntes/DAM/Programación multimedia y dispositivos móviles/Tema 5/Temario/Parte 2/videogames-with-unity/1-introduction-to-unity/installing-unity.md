To get started with **Unity**, you need to **register** at [Unity's official website](http://unity3d.com). After registration, **download the Unity Hub** from the same site to manage your Unity Editor installations and projects efficiently.

> [!danger]
> When installing **Unity** Editor is important to decide what additional modules we want to add. By default, **Unity** doesn't install all complementary modules and destination platforms. So if we want to be able to deploy for **Android**, iOS etc. we have to **add** the corresponding modules and **SDKs**. Anyway, it is always **possible** to **add** them at **any** **time.**


> [!warning]
> * In **Windows** **OS**, Unity recommends installing **Visual** **Studio** for **C# script** development.
> * However, Unity is compatible with **alternative** editors like **Visual Studio Code,** Sublime Text, Rider, etc.
