So far, the **Scene View** is the most important view in Unity. Applications or games in Unity are divided into **scenes**, such as different **levels** in a game or the introduction screen. The Scene View allows you to add and edit objects, cameras, lights, particle systems, and GUI elements.

Let's see in the next video how to do use the **essential** **tools** of the Scene View:

1. **Manipulating Objects**: You can select an object (e.g. a cube) and change its **position**, **rotation**, and **scale**. You can **zoom** **in** **and** **out** using the **mouse** **wheel**. All these manipulations can be done using the collection of buttons at the top of the Scene View.
2. **Maximizing Scene View**: You can maximize the Scene View by pressing **Shift + Spacebar**. This is useful when you want to focus on manipulating objects in the scene.
3. **Gizmos**: Gizmos are **visual** **aids** that help in manipulating objects. They appear as arrows when you select an object and can help you move, rotate, or scale the object.
4. **Hand Tool**: The Hand Tool allows you to change the position of the scene. If you press the **Alt** key, you can rotate around the selected object (**orbital mode**).
5. **Focusing on an Object**: You can focus on a specific object by pressing the **F** key. This centers the object in the view, which is useful when you want to rotate or move the object.
6. **Moving, Rotating, and Scaling Objects**: You can move an object along a specific axis or in a plane. You can rotate an object around its center. You can scale an object along a specific axis or proportionally in all three axes. You can undo any action by pressing Control + Z or Command + Z.
7. **Scaling Tool**: This tool is generally used for 2D objects and GUI elements. It allows you to scale an object along a specific axis or proportionally in all three axes.
8. **Global axes gizmo:** On the top-right of the scene view, allows to change scene perspective (isometric or parallel) and also watch scene from specific axes.
