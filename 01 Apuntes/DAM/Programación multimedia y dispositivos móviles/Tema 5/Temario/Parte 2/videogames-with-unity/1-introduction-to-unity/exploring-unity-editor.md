## Introduction to Editor and Views

The next **video** introduces the following **key** **points** about **Unity**:

1. **Unity Editor**: The Unity Editor is the **primary** **tool** for working with Unity. The editor is used to create “**scenes**” for your projects.
2. **Creating a Project**: A new 3D project named “test” is created as an example. No changes are made to the default settings.
3. **Views in Unity Editor**: The Unity Editor is divided into several views, including the **Hierarchy** View, **Scene** View, **Game** View, **Inspector** View, **Project** View, and **Console** View.
4. **Working with Views**: You can **select**, **move**, **dock**, or even **make** any **view** **independent** (useful when working with multiple monitors). You can also **close** a **view** and **reopen** it from the **Window** **menu**.
5. **Layouts**: Unity provides several **layout** options for the distribution **of views**. You can **save** your specific **distribution** of views **under** a **name** for easy access later.
6. **Other Topics**: In the future, how to create **C#** **scripts**.
