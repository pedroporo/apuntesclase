Let's see another important view: **Hierarchy View.**  This view complements the Scene View and is essential for **organizing** and **managing** objects in your **scene,** also enables creating **parent**-**child** relationships between objects.

The video highlights:

* **A "wall" made of "cubes" is created** by **duplication** (Ctrl/Cmd + D), using also snapping for precise positioning in the scene.
* **Empty Game Objects**: An empty game object is created and named “wall”. Empty game objects are useful for grouping collections of game objects.
* **Parent-Child Relationships**: The cubes are made children of the “wall” object, creating a parent-child relationship. This allows you to move all the cubes together by moving the parent object. You can also select and modify individual cubes.
* **Focusing on an Object**: You can focus on an object in the Scene View by pressing the **F** key or by double-clicking the object in the Hierarchy View.
