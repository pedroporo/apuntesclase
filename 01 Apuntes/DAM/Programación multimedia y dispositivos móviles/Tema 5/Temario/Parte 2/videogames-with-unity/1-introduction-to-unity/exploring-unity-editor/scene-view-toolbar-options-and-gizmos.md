The scene view allows other advanced options. These options are visible as **buttons** on the top of the view.

They are not required at the beginning when learning **Unity**, but we briefly describe the most important ones:

* **Draw mode:** The first menu allows us to establish how we want to see the objects in the scene view (not in the game view). The most important ones are **Shaded** (with texture), **Wireframe** and **ShadedWireframe** (mixed).

  + The others are quite advanced: Render Paths (how the objects are rendered, green with deferred lighting, yellow for forward rendering and red for vertex lit), the Alpha channel, the areas with more graphic load (Overdraw) and Mipmaps that can give us information about the right size of the texture for the different objects (red means textures are bigger than really required, blue that texture should be bigger)
* The **'2D'** button allows us to change the scene view to 2D or 3D mode
* **Lighting**: The next icon allows us to see the light will the actual collection of light or with an ambient light
* **Audio**: The audio icon allows us to reproduce or not sounds in the scene view
* **Effects:** The next button allows us to show/hide in the scene elements such as SkyBox, fogs, flares and animated materials
* **Scene visibility switch:** toggles Scene visibility for GameObjects on and off.
* **Camera settings menu** : contains options for configuring the Scene view camera.
* **Gizmos:** contains options for how objects, icons, and gizmos are displayed. This menu is available in both the Scene view and the Game view.
