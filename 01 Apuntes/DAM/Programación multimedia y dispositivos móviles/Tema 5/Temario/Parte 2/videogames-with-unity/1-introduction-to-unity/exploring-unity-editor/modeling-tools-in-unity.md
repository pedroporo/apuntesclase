# Modeling tools in Unity

Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/1.-introduction-to-unity/exploring-unity-editor/modeling-tools-in-unity

One of the first questions a new user has in **Unity** is how we can model objects and characters in the editor. The answer is: **Unity** **has no modeling tools by defaul**t, although there is a complement called **ProBuilder** we can use to add some modeling tools mainly **focused** on **level** **creation**.

**Unity** editor was designed for:

* **Importing** **elements** created in specific environments, such as Blender, 3D Max, Maya, etc. And not only models but animations as well.
* **Using** these **elements** in a scene.

**3D** **modeling** and **animation** are really complex and deserve very specific tools, although in **Unity** there are some tasks we can do.

## Using simple models in our examples

Is it possible to use some basic models without having to import anything in **Unity**?

Yes, it is. Frrom menu **GameObject** **->** **3D** **Object** we will find, among others, gameobject of simple geometry such as **Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder, Plane and Quad**.

📔 Open **Unity** and try it out. Put a **Cube** in a scene.

## Which is the best format when importing models into **Unity**?

While **Unity** supports various formats, **.fbx** is the **recommended** format for importing models and animations.

**Export** to **.fbx** format from **3D** **modeling** **tools** whenever it's possible.
