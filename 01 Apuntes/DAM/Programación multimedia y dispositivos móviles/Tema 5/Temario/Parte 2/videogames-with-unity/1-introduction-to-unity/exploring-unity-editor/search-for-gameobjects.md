A search term acts as a **filter** for the GameObjects in the Scene view and Hierarchy Window:

* In the **Scene view**, GameObjects that match the search term **appear in color**. All other GameObjects appear in **gray**.
* In the **Hierarchy window**, GameObjects that match the search term **appear** in **alphabetical** **order**. All the other GameObjects disappear from view.
