Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/1.-introduction-to-unity/asset-store

The Unity **Asset Store** contains a **library** of **free** and **commercial** **assets** that Unity Technologies and members of the community create. A wide variety of assets are available, including textures, models, animations, entire project examples, tutorials, and Editor extensions.

You get access to the Unity's Asset Store at: <https://assetstore.unity.com/>

## Step 1: Add to "My Asset" list

1. Go to Unity Asset Store <https://assetstore.unity.com/> on your browser.
2. **Sign** In to your **Unity** **account** both in the asset store window and in Unity Editor.
3. Browse for the best asset of your choice.
4. If it’s a paid asset, make the payment.
5. Click on “**Add to My Assets**” button. This will add the asset to your asset list.

## Step 2: Importing "Asset" into your project

1. Inside Unity, Open Unity Package Manager by going to **Window->PackageManager.**
2. Wait for the package manager to populate the list.
3. Select **My** **Assets** from the dropdown on the top left corner.
4. **Select** the **asset** you want from the list and **click** **download**. If it’s already downloaded, then you will see an import option.

**Package Manager Error:** If you get an error while loading "My Assets", close the Unity Editor and Unity Hub. Then, reopen Unity Hub and your project. "My Assets" should now load correctly.
