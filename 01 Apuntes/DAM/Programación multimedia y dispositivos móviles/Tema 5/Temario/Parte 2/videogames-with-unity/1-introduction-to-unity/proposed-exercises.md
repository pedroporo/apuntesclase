## 1. Practice basic skills using assets from the Unity Asset Store

Unity Asset Store is plenty of assets (many free of charge) that can significantly speed up your game development process:

* **Explore** the Unity Asset Store to find assets suitable for **building** **a city** **scene**.
* **Create** your **own** **city** within a Unity scene **using** these **assets**.
* **Practice** **essential** **skills**:

  + **Snapping**: Ensure that your city **elements** **align** **correctly**. Use snapping to position objects precisely.
  + **Duplicating Elements**: Experiment with **duplicating** buildings, trees, or other urban features. Create variations by modifying their **scale**, **rotation**, or materials.
  + **Grouping Objects**: Organize your city by grouping related objects. Create empty GameObjects as parents to group elements together logically (e.g., all buildings in one group, roads in another).

## **2. Additional practice**

* Consider **adding** **lighting**, **terrain**, and other environmental elements to enhance your city scene.
* **Experiment** with different asset combinations to achieve a diverse and realistic cityscape.
