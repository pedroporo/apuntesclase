In the following video, you will learn the **main points** of the **most** **important** **views** in Unity:

* **Scene View**: This is the most important view in Unity. It’s where you **create** and **manage** scenes, which are the foundation of your applications or games. You can **add** **objects**, **cameras**, **lights**, and other essential elements in this view.
* **Hierarchy View**: This view provides a list of the elements in your scene (**scene** **graph**). It allows you to create **parent**-**child** **relationships** between different objects.
* **Project View**: This view visualizes your **assets** **folder**, where you store and organize the resources needed for your game or application.
* **Inspector View**: When you select an object, this view provides information about its **properties**. The properties of the object are grouped into **components**.
* **Game View**: This view allows you to **run** your **game** **inside** the **editor**. It’s useful for testing your interactive application or game without deploying to the physical device.
* **Console View**: This view displays warnings, errors, and your own messages, which is helpful for debugging your application or game.
