## Overview

* In the following series of videos, are going to create a **multi-scene 1st person game (Destroy Stones)** that incorporates all our acquired skills.
* This game will be **easy** to **expand** and also something you’ll be **proud** of.

## Destroy Stones Game

In **Destroy Stones**, players face a challenging game where a fixed number of random stones are thrown from the bottom of the screen to top.

The **objective** is to **destroy** as many stones as possible by **tapping** on them **before** they **fall** **down** and **disappear**. The game tests your reflexes and accuracy as you aim to achieve the highest score by destroying the stones.

## **Scenes**

* **Initial Scene**: Shows a play button (that jumps to game scene)
* **Game Scene:** To Play the game
* **Final Scene**: Shows a summary of stones destroyed and a button to restart the game.
