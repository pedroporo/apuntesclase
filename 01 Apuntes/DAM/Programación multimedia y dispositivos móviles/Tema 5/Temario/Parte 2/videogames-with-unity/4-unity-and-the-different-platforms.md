Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/4.-unity-and-the-different-platforms

When developing using Unity, you can deploy to a diverse number of platforms: desktop, consoles, mobile devices, web, VR/AR devices,....etc.

**Unity** keeps most characteristics as **platform**-**independent**. However, elements such as game controls, rendering capabilities, or aspect ratios may vary.

In Unity, the **Build** **Settings** section allows you to select the deployment platform. Unity automatically handles any necessary conversions when switch platforms. In **Player** **Settings**, you can configure options that meet your needs to a specific platform: resolution and presentation, app icon, splash screen, etc.
