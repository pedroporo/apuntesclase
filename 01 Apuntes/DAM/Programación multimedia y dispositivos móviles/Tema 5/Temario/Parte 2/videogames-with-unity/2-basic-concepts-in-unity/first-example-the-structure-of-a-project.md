Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/2.-basic-concepts-in-unity/first-example-the-structure-of-a-project

In the upcoming videos, we will create a **new 3D project** then, explore fundamental aspects:

* **Project** **folder** **structure:** Keep your project neat and manageable by organizing assets into specific subfolders such as Scenes, Scripts, Materials, and more.
* **Default scene**: The project starts with a default scene that includes a **main** **camera** and **directional** **light**. The name of this scene can be changed anytime.
* **Adding** **objects** **to the scene**: Discover how to populate scenes with different objects.
* **Adjust** **camera** **point** **of** **view**: Learn how to move camera manually or align it to match the current viewpoint, helping you capture the perfect angle for your scenes.
* **Creating Materials:** Learn how to craft materials that enhance the visual appearance of your gameobjects, giving them a lifelike surface texture.
