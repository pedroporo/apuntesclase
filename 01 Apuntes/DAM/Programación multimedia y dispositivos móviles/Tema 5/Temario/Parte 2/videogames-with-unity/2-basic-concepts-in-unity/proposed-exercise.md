## **Enhancing Materials in Unity with Textures**

**Objective**: Modify materials in Unity to go beyond simple color changes. We’ll apply textures (**images**) as “skins” to our scene elements.

**Steps**:

1. **Texture Search**: Explore the internet for textures you’d like to use. These could be images of wood, metal, fabric, or any other material you want to apply to your objects.
2. **Import Textures**: Import these textures into Unity. You can do this by dragging them from a folder directly into the Unity editor, specifically in the “Project” view.

> To keep things **organized**, create a dedicated folder within your project to store these textures.


1. **Material Adjustment**:

* Locate the material you want to modify (e.g., the material applied to a sphere, cube, or plane).
* Open the material settings.
* Change the color of the “**Albedo**” property back to **white:** This ensures that the selected color doesn’t interfere with our texture.
* In the same “Albedo” field, **apply** the newly imported **texture**. You can do this by either:

  + Dragging and dropping the texture onto the square to the left of “Albedo.”
  + Selecting the texture by clicking on the circle to the right of “Albedo.”

1. **Result**: Your scene’s objects (such as spheres, cubes, or planes) should now be adorned with the imported texture, giving them a realistic appearance.

**Remember** to **experiment** with **different** **textures** and see how they beautify your scene! 🌟🎨
