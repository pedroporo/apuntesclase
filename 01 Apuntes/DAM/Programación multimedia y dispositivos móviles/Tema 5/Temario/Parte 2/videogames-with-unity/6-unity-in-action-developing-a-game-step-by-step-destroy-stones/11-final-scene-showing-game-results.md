This **Final Screen** will display very simple interface:

* Two **Texts** with a **summary** of:

  + Number of **stones** **destroyed** by the player
  + Number of **stones** **thrown.**
* A **Button "Restart"** to return back to the "Awake" scene (to play a new game)

Let's see in the next video how to **set up** the **FinalScreen** (similarly to how we did for the Awake screen).
