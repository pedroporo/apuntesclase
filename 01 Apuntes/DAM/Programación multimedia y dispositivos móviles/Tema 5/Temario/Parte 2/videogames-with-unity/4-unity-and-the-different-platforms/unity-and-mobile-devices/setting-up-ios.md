Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/4.-unity-and-the-different-platforms/unity-and-mobile-devices/setting-up-ios

To create a Unity application for **iOS,** you first need to set up your Unity project to support iOS. This information is also relevant to the iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS platforms.

To support iOS and other Apple operating systems, a Unity project requires:

* The **iOS Build Support** module.
* [**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (installed on local Macos machine) or [**Unity Build Automation**](https://unity.com/products/cloud-build)(using Unity's Servers on the cloud)

Before you get started, check Unity’s [Requirements and compatibility documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ios-requirements-and-compatibility.html) for iOS to make sure you’re aware of any limitations for developing a Unity application for this platform.
