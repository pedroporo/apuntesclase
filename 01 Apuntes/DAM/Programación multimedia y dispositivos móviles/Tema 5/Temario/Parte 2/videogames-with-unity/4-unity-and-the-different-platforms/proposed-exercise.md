## Make Sphere Jump using **Accelerometer**

**For this exercise**, ensure you can **deploy** your Unity application to a **mobile** device.

Let’s create an interesting exercise with accelerometers:

* We’ll make a **sphere** jump **when** an **abrupt** **movement** is detected **along** the **Z-axis** of the accelerometer.
* Imagine the **mobile** **screen** **facing** **up** – we want to simulate how the sphere would behave if it were on the plane formed by the device screen.

**Follow these steps**:

* **Existing Jump Code**: You already have the code to make the sphere jump (e.g., triggered by tapping the screen). We’ll modify this behavior.
* **New Condition**: Instead of jumping when we tap, we’ll trigger the jump when the Z accelerometer value exceeds a certain positive threshold. **Experiment** with different **threshold** **values** to find an appropriate one.
* **Testing**:

  + Test your modified code on your mobile device.
  + **Observe** how the sphere responds to **abrupt** **upward**/**downward** movements along the Z-axis. **Remember** to **adjust** the **threshold** **value** to achieve the desired effect! 📱🏀🚀
