However, **console development,** requires**:**

1. **Access Requirements** - Ensure you have **developer** **access** for your target console platform. This often involves a **registration** and approval process with the console **manufacturer**.
2. **Install Console Platform Support** - Within Unity Hub, after registering your console developer account, you will find options to download and install modules supporting your console.
