# Touching the Screen

Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/4.-unity-and-the-different-platforms/unity-and-mobile-devices/touching-the-screen

In this video, we are going to learn how to **make** the **sphere** **jump** whenever device **screen** is **touched.**

We'll use:

* `Input.touchCount` to detect any touches, and
* `Input.touches` for accessing each touch's details,

allowing us to react to screen interactions.
