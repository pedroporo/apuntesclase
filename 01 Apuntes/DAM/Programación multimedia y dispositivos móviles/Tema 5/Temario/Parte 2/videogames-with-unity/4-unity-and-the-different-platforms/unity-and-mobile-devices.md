Mobile devices have **unique** **characteristics** distinct from those of other platforms, including smaller screens and various sensors. Testing for mobile can be time-consuming if it requires building and deploying to a mobile device every time. However, using **Unity** **Remote** can simplify this process.

**Unity** **Remote** is an app for Android, iOS, and tvOS development that allows to **test** how an **app** looks and behaves **on** **the** **device** **without** making a **build**. Unity Remote works by linking your device to the Unity Editor. It displays the visual output on your device at a lower frame rate while sending device inputs back to Unity. More information at:
