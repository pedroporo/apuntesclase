## C# and Unity

The programming language we are using to write the scripts in Unity is **C#**.

* C # is a standard language easy to learn if you have previous knowledge of Java or C ++.
* It is not necessary to master this programming language but it is a fundamental element for those who want to become an expert in **Unity**, since the mastery of the language can allow us to do more and better things in our scripts.
* With some basic notions of programming it's easy to to follow the examples without too much difficulty.
* However, as a complementary material, students interested in this language can learn more about their characteristics in the following **introduction to C#** in pdf:
