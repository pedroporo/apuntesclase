# Unity Scripts.  Basic methods (Event functions)

Source: https://ecm-pmdm-unity.gitbook.io/videogames-with-unity/5.-scripting/unity-scripts.-basic-methods-event-functions

* In Unity, scripts aren't traditional looping programs but are driven by event functions responding to gameplay events. These functions are intermittently called by Unity, not running on a continuous loop.
* Unity identifies the appropriate function for an event based on its naming scheme. Common examples include `Update` (called before a frame update) and `Start` (called before the first frame update).

The **next** **video**, we'll guide you through the appropriate use of the **most** **common** **event** **methods**.

For a comprehensive list of **event** functions and **order** of **execution**, refer to Unity's script reference page: <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html>
